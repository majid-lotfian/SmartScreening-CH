# SmartScreening-CH
Developing and evaluating clinical foundation models and machine learning models to support early detection of Congenital Hypothyroidism and its types using tabular datasets.

This repository explores machine learning approaches to reduce false positive referrals in Congenital Hypothyroidism screening. It utilizes Random Forest, CatBoost, and XGBoost models trained on screening data, enhanced with Amino Acid and Acylcarnitine profiles, and integrates principles from foundation models to improve generalization.
